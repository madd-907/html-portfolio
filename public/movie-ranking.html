<h1>The Best Movies According to Maddi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>I think this is a classic chick flick that just satisfies that period drama romance itch for a "feel-good" movie experience</p>
<h3>Phantom of the Opera</h3>
<p>Everyone needs a little musical in their life and this one is just so iconic and enjoyable.</p>
<h3>Talladega Nights</h3>
<p>A Will Ferrel staple. No further explanation is necessary.</p>
